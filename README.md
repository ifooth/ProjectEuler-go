Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Here we will solve them using Python with purely functional programming style.

Some people have expressed their concerns about making the solutions of the Euler Project public. While the risk of having people using them unjustly certainly exists (shame on them), the benefits of sharing knowledge should exceed this petty inconvenient.
